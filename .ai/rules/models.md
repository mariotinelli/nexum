# Models

## Cast persisted enums on models
Cast every persisted enum attribute to its enum class on the Eloquent model. Keep models focused on persistence, relationships, public local scopes, and casts.

## Type Eloquent relationships
Declare explicit Laravel relationship return types on all Eloquent relationship methods.

## Use project money and datetime casts
Use App\Casts\Money for monetary attributes and App\Casts\Datetime for date or datetime attributes that participate in forms.
